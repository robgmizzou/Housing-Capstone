# Housing-Capstone

### Selected Topic:
The scope of this project is to review Wake County housing trends by zip code. We would like to review data over the last 60 months from June of 2017 through June of 2022 to identify changes in the market. Potential factors that may have impacted Wake County's market:
1. The Covid 19 pandemic.
2. Apple's New Raleigh, NC Campus expected to bring in 3,000 new jobs.
3. The expansion of the 540 expected to link Apex, Cary, Clayton, Garner, Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs and Raleigh when fully operational.
4. The Bus Rapid Transit project expected to be completed by 2030.
5. Labor and supply chain shortages.
